<p> I personally would not illegally download music off online because its illegal. Iy also is a waist of time and peoples money when you can stream music off of multiple apps for free(also not illegal)
<h2 title="research"</h2>
<p> Webster university says that you can up to five years in jail, fines up to 150,000 for per file, and depending on who you copy it fro, they can press charges. All that just for risking going to jail for music
