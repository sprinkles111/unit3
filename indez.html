  <h2  <p>People illegally download music over the internet. Although its free to download, its still illegal
      <h2 title="Cons" </h2>
      <p> Why you should NOT sell illegal music<br/>
        You can ger cuaght<br/>
        you can possibly get charged with attempt theft<br/>
        its just stupid<br/>
        <h2 title="Pros"</h2>
        <p> Why you should download illegal music<br/>
          Free music<br/>
        Sell it to other people that dont know its illegal<br/>
       Ur lost in the head <br/>
       <h2 title="My Point of View"</h2>
       <p> I personally would not illegally download music off online because its illegal. Iy also is a waist of time and peoples money when you can stream music off of multiple apps for free(also not illegal)
  <h2 title="research"</h2>
  <p> Webster university says that you can up to five years in jail, fines up to 150,000 for per file, and depending on who you copy it fro, they can press charges. All that just for risking going to jail for music
